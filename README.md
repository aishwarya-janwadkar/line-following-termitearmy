Behaviour in Motion

The brief for this project was to design an interactive piece that uses one or more servo motors with CircuitPython to create something that feels alive and behaves through movement.

Army of termites

This idea evolved from the concept of understanding behaviour and motion in social insects such as termites. The army of termites includes a queen, a soldier and a worker termite. they project two behaviours -

1. Communication in the Termite Colony
When blind termite workers wander out into the world, they need a way to let the other termites know where they are going, and they also need something to mark the way back. Trail pheromones are chemical markers that lead termites along a path to food and help them return to the colony once they've found it. Termite workers following trail pheromones march along the designated path, sniffing their way forward with their antennae.
To illustrate this behaviour, the soldier and the worker, follow the queen through line following sensors.

2.Termite Soldiers Sound the Alarm
Termite soldiers form the world's tiniest heavy metal mosh pit when danger comes to the nest. To sound the alarm, soldiers bang their heads against the gallery walls to send warning vibrations throughout the colony.
The soldier termite has a solonoid embedded in its head that turns on when their is a loud sound.
